          <p>Hey, I just want to give you something. At first, I hesitated to share this because I didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable (I'm sorry if I did) or bring up any past emotions. However, after careful consideration, I realized that sometimes you should do what is left undone, even if it turns out differently than you expect. <br><br>

            This "something" that I will give you is an inspired digital flower. I call it inspired because it is driven by motivation. Remember when we stumbled upon a TikTok video about giving someone a digital flower, I realized and found it to be a thoughtful and cute idea of giving someone a flower and you know, that fuels and inspired me to continue studying CSS (a part of webdev) even though it can be challenging. <br><br>
            
            I understand that this digital flower isn't the typical one and this may seem undervalued. But the process and my intention in creating this digitalized flower are genuine. It's not the usual bouquet; rather, it's a unique creation shaped by the twists and turns of my journey. Every line of code holds a piece of dedication and the joy I've found in this creative exploration. <br><br>
            
            I hope despite its simplicity, you find beauty in its unconventional form. While it may not replace the physical flower, it represents a different kind of effort and sentiment. Hope you like it :) Happy Valentine's.
